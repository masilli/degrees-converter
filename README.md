# degrees-converter
A javascript calculator that converts celsius into fahrenheit and kelvin and the other way around
This was an exercise on my Developer Course that I wanted to boost with more functionalites and animations
It was only supposed to convert Celsius into Fahrenheit and Kelvin, but I tought that converting any which into the others was the obvious thing to do
